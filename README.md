Below is the animation steps.

In addition, SVG animation is very interesting, I really like.
Although you can use AE, PS and other software to make a very smooth animation, but to developers always use the picture sequence frames, so easily lead to the animation is not smooth, and bulky, affecting the overall performance.
SVG animation is very lightweight, and can seamlessly interface with front-end developers.
